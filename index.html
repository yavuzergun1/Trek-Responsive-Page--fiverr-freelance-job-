                Madone has been dedicated to speed since its inception. But as
                both bikes and bike racing get faster, it takes better
                technology than ever to stay ahead of the pack.

                  <strong>IsoFlow, total pressure, and frame drag</strong>
                  The most obvious change in the new Madone is the brand-new
                  IsoFlow feature, which improves aerodynamics, weight, and
                  rider comfort. But how does it reduce drag?
                </p>
                <p>
                  IsoFlow was first conceived by identifying higher-drag areas
                  on the sixth generation Madone and studying the airflow in
                  those spots. In the early stages of design, we do this using
                  an airflow simulation software called computational fluid
                  dynamics (CFD).

                We often aren’t as concerned with modeling smaller components
                like bottle cages and spokes at this point in the design
                process. Instead, we’re focused on increasing simulation speed
                to iterate through more designs. The result is a simulation that
                relatively accurately models bulk airflow movement and can be
                solved in a matter of hours, rather than days, using our
                supercomputers. The one thing we never omit is the rider
                (although sometimes we hide them for visualization), which we
                include in CFD either dynamically pedaling or modeling a range
                of leg positions across the pedal cycle. We simulate thousands
                of conditions and prototypes in CFD to quickly study more
                designs than would ever be possible with wind tunnel or ride
                testing.

                Below is an illustration of early-stage CFD on the previous
                generation Madone compared to an IsoFlow concept bike. Here, we
                visualize high-drag areas as “clouds” where red represents the
                most drag being produced. In this instance, the rider is hidden
                from view to allow us to better see what the airflow is doing on
                the frame. This illustration clearly shows how drag hotspots are
                cleaned up by the inclusion of new IsoFlow.

                While the red clouds are a proxy for drag, what they really
                represent is “total pressure.” Without diving too deep into
                aerodynamic concepts, you can think about total pressure as a
                measure of energy in the flow. We want to avoid areas of low
                total pressure (or low energy) because they cause drag.
                Depending on how interesting your physics teacher was, you may
                remember learning about conservation of energy. It applies here
                – if energy is being removed from the airflow, it is coming from
                somewhere. In this case, that somewhere is your legs!
              </p>
              <p>
                In Madone SLR’s new design, IsoFlow is able to increase the
                energy of the flow around and through the seat stay cluster by
                providing a clear path for airflow. This improves upon the
                traditional design in which air must squeeze around the seat
                tube and seat stays, causing it to interact with your moving
                legs and in turn increase drag.

                <strong>IsoFlow and rider drag</strong>
                IsoFlow does more than just reduce drag on the frame. The
                fast-moving air that travels through IsoFlow helps add energy to
                the area where the most drag of all is generated – behind and
                below the rider. As you pedal, counter-rotating vortices are
                formed as air tries to negotiate all the twists and turns it
                needs to travel around your back and legs. This effect is
                documented in some well-respected
                <a
                  href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271904963_Flow_topology_in_the_wake_of_a_cyclist_and_its_effect_on_aerodynamic_drag"
                  >university studies</a
                >, and we can see it in our CFD as well. In the animation below,
                the counter-rotating vortices are colored by the magnitude and
                direction of their rotation to differentiate the two.

                Most of the drag on the bike-rider system comes from the rider,
                and much of it stems from this very effect. IsoFlow helps direct
                air into this low-pressure area and reduce the drag the rider
                creates. The effect is small, but any small change to the huge
                amount of drag a rider generates can often be more impactful
                than reductions to frame drag. The animation below shows the
                rider vortices again, but this time colored by total pressure
                and highlighting the streamlines through IsoFlow that move up to
                add energy to the rider wake.

                When it matters most, riders use aerodynamic components like
                disc wheels that still give a boost, even in “dirty air.”

                <strong>Dealing with “dirty air”</strong>

                Located at the back of the bike and surrounded by “dirty air,”
                you may wonder if features like IsoFlow can have much potential
                for aerodynamic improvement. It’s true – dirty air – the
                turbulent air near the back of the bike caused by rotating
                wheels and pedaling legs – introduces a real challenge. But a
                bike’s predominant airflow can still be influenced to reduce
                drag.
              </p>
              <p>
                Formula 1 cars have aerodynamic features from the front to the
                back of the car to optimize airflow, even though dirty air
                becomes more of a problem as the air moves along the car. On
                bikes, the benefit of aerodynamic components when it comes to
                cutting through dirty air around the back of the bike has been
                proven many times across all racing disciplines – time trial,
                triathlon, track – through the use of rear aerodynamic disc
                wheels.
              </p>

                The effects of pedaling and “dirty air” can be studied more in
                the wind tunnel, which is where we bring our prototypes after
                our most promising concepts emerge from computational fluid
                dynamics. The wind tunnels we use are trusted by leading
                aerospace companies for their design and research for their
                ability to measure tiny changes in drag force and boast
                high-quality airflow.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just like with CFD, we always test aerodynamics with a rider on
                the bike. After all – bikes don’t ride themselves. And the rider
                has an enormous impact on the aerodynamic qualities of a frame.
                But rider inclusion presents a problem. We’re often changing
                surfaces by mere millimeters between designs, so our results in
                the wind tunnel must be very repeatable to detect drag
                differences from model to model. Even the most experienced
                professional cyclists are not able to repeat their movements
                accurately enough for us to isolate a subtle effect from a
                single minor design change. So, what do we do?

                Manny combines the benefits of testing with a rider (including
                realistic aerodynamics and the ability to study effects of
                turbulence generated by the body and by pedaling) while avoiding
                the drawbacks of a human who can’t maintain perfect position
                (and who may complain after a long day of wind tunnel testing).
                With Manny, we can study design changes with a repeatability of
                about ±1 Watt at 45 km/h. We still conduct wind tunnel tests
                with live riders to verify our results and study equipment
                impact on specific Trek-Segafredo racers, but Manny is where the
                magic begins.

                  To make sure we get the same results test to test, we follow a
                  specific wind tunnel testing protocol every time. Manny’s legs
                  and the bike wheels both spin to mimic road conditions. Then,
                  using a turntable, we rotate the whole setup across yaw angles
                  (the angle wind hits you as you ride) from -25° to +25° to
                  simulate crosswinds. These conditions represent most yaw
                  angles a normal rider will experience. We do most testing at
                  or near 45 km/h (for aero geeks, the exact speed changes test
                  to test because we test at a constant Reynolds number), but we
                  confirm our results at lower speeds as well. The result is a
                  drag (measured in C<sub>DA</sub>) versus yaw sweep that looks
                  like this:
                </p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>
                This data shows that the drag improvements estimated in CFD were
                validated in the wind tunnel. With just a bike change from the
                previous generation to the new seventh generation Madone, the
                drag dramatically drops as the rider enters even minor crosswind
                conditions. In this scenario, the rider is in the exact same
                position when comparing the previous generation to the new bike.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, if the rider uses the new Madone bar/stem and keeps
                their same bar size from the previous generations, their
                shifters are moved inboard 3 cm. The resulting aerodynamic
                position has an additional drag reduction at almost all yaw
                angles, especially low crosswind conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the rider wants to forgo a narrower arm position, they can
                either size up their new Madone bar/stem or use another bar
                solution. They will still see the improvements from the bike,
                but not the position change.

              <p>
                <strong>What does this mean for riders?</strong>
                For a simpler way to compare bikes, we can average the drag
                across all yaw angles to get one drag number for each bike.
                However, a straight average is not representative of the real
                world, because you don’t encounter every yaw angle an equal
                amount of time. Instead, we must apply a weighted average that
                accounts for how often you see each angle or crosswind
                condition.
              </p>
              <p>
                To do this, we calculated the theoretical percentage of time a
                rider will spend at each yaw angle across many rides and wind
                conditions using the Rayleigh wind distribution that
                approximates normal wind conditions on Earth. We then validated
                those calculations with data we collected during real-world
                rides with a wind sensor onboard the bike. The most common
                conditions are low crosswind – or low yaw angle
                –&nbsp;conditions (0° is the most common). No single ride will
                exactly match this yaw distribution, but the longer you ride,
                the closer you approach it over time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, to make the data more meaningful, the yaw-weighted drag
                is converted into power savings and time savings from the new
                bike. For example, the bike and position change combine for a 60
                second time savings over an hour for a rider putting in the same
                effort relative to the previous generation Madone.

                The Madone was designed with our professional race team in mind,
                but all riders can benefit from these aerodynamic gains. The
                time savings a rider will see are

                  ></span
                >
                as you might think, since at lower speeds you have more time to
                take advantage of the aerodynamic benefit.
              </p>
              <p>
                And for the pro riders who need to contend with ever-increasing
                race speeds, the new Madone is a crucial addition to the suite
                of aerodynamic advancements at their disposal. With these wind
                tunnel results, at the average Spring Monument speeds of today,
                the new Madone SLR and its aero handlebar position could help a
                rider switching from the old Madone increase their speed another
                0.7 km/h. That’s almost half of the total increase in race speed
                since the original Madone in 2003, and a true evolution in
                aerodynamics.
